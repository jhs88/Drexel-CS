"console screenshot.PNG" contains a screenshot of the output of "sum.asm" in QtSpim
"suma trace.txt" is a trace of the main function of "suma.asm"
"sump trace.txt" is a trace of the main function of "sum.asm"
"sumr trace.txt" is a trace of the main function of "sumr.asm"
    Each trace line has its machine code and instruction
    Underneath each trace are the changes to the registery and stack for that instruction
    I also go into how the looping structure works for each.
