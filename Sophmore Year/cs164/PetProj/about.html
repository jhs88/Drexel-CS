      My pet has five different stages: sleep, hunger, fun, love, alive.
      There are simuli that effect each of these states: eat, play, rest, death.
      Eating will increase love and hunger, but if you feed the pet too much it dies, affecting alive.
      Playing with the pet will effect sleep, hunger, but increase love.
      Resting will reset all of the states.
      There also is a function that was created to create more randomness to the pet called choice.
      The function choices a simuli based on a random number to run giving the appearance that the pet is making a decision.
